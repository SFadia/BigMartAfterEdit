## by Fadia Saleh


## Dataset

> The dataset represents BigMart grocery stores, include pricing of different products types and different factors that affect the price 



## Summary of Findings

> I started by wrangling the data and used different visiuals in order to understand what is the factors that affect the price in the data


## Key Insights for Presentation

> the factors affect the maxiumim retail price are two first the type of the product, second the amount of the fats in this product, so if the fat content for a product is low that means its definatly expensive product than the products with regular fats, at the first i thought by changing from a product to another that will change but by checking all the proucts vs both price and fat content i got a confirmation that low fats products is expensive no matter what is the product type
